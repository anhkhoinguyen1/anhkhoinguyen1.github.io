                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called
                        titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants
                        truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears
                        to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within
                        defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However,
                        that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly
                        impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

                    <p>
                        After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager
                        dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military
                        unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime
                        Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister
                        Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the
                        titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

                        manga of the same name.
