                    <h5>Synopsis</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and
                        write their victim's name in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the
                        shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one into
                        the human realm.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores
                        the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it. When the
                        criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly
                        surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could
                        be.
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    With this divine capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order to build a new
                    world where crime does not exist and people worship him as a god. Police, however, quickly
                    discover that a serial killer is targeting criminals and, consequently, try to apprehend the
                    culprit. To do this, the Japanese investigators count on the assistance of the best detective in
                    the world: a young and eccentric man known only by the name of L.
