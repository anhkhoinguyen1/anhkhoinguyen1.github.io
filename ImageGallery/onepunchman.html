                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero. In
                        order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his
                        hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to
                        defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to
                        an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite
                        bored.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's
                        disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero
                        Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive
                        contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And
                        thus begins the story of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual
                        who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and
                        just maybe, he'll become popular in the process.

                        One Punch Man is based on Yusuke Murata's manga remake of ONE's original web comic. The anime
                        adapts the first 7 volumes of the manga.
